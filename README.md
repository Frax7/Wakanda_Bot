# Wakanda_Bot

This is my very first telegram bot and it's made in elixir.

## Start

* **1- Get token**

Create a new bot by talking to **@BotFather** in Telegram. Once you get your token, you are ready.

* **2- Insert token**

Go to the **config.ex** file, and replace _\<token\>_ by your token.

* **3- Run**

Use the comman **mix run --no-halt** and let the show begins.

## Telegram commands

* **\start** will make the bot strats.

* **\name** must be followed by any string wich will be traduced.
